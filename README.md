# Custom Language and Compiler
This project implements a custom programming language and its compiler using C, C++, Yacc, and Lex. The language supports basic programming constructs, allowing users to write, parse, and compile code into executable instructions.

# Features
- Custom Syntax and Grammar:
  - Designed using Yacc for grammar definition.
- Lexical Analysis:
  - Tokenizes input code using Lex, handling keywords, identifiers, and operators.
= Semantic Analysis and Code Generation:
  -Written in C/C++, generates executable or intermediate code.
- Error Handling:
  - Detects and reports syntax and semantic errors with descriptive messages.
